    "questionText": "A group of pupils set up an experiment using four similar towels. They hung the towels as shown below. After one hour, they measured the amount of water collected in the containers. Which of the following towels will have the greatest amount of water collected in the container?",
    "options": [
      "Towel A: Completely covered in plastic wrap.",
      "Towel B: Half covered in plastic wrap.",
      "Towel C: Sprinkled with some water.",
      "Towel D: Placed under a fan."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "The amount of water collected indicates the rate of evaporation. Evaporation is affected by factors like surface area, humidity, temperature and wind. Placing the towel under a fan (Towel D) increases the wind speed, hence increases the rate of evaporation, thus resulting in the greatest amount of water collected."

    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "For a container to store fruits so that you can see the fruits inside, the material needs to be transparent. From the table, only Material R is transparent. Although it is preferable for the container to float on water, this is not a requirement for it to store fruits. Flexibility is also not a necessary requirement."

    "questionText": "A scientist placed a potted plant in a completely sealed glass box. She also placed a tray of soda lime (a chemical that absorbs carbon dioxide, CO2) inside the box. After 48 hours, what is the most likely outcome for the plant's processes?",
    "options": [
      "Photosynthesis rate increases, Respiration rate decreases.",
      "Both Photosynthesis and Respiration rates decrease significantly.",
      "Photosynthesis rate decreases significantly, Respiration rate remains active until stored food is depleted.",
      "Photosynthesis stops, Respiration continues until all oxygen is used up."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Soda lime removes CO2, which is essential for photosynthesis (food making). Thus, photosynthesis will decrease significantly. Respiration uses oxygen and releases CO2, sustaining the plant by breaking down stored food (sugar/starch). Respiration will continue actively as long as oxygen and stored food are available, even if photosynthesis stops."

    "questionText": "Which characteristic is shared by both bacteria and toadstools (a type of fungus) but is generally absent in most green plants?",
    "options": [
      "They reproduce by producing spores.",
      "They are non-living organisms.",
      "They obtain nutrition by feeding on dead or decaying matter.",
      "They must live in dark environments to survive."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Both fungi (toadstools) and many bacteria are decomposers or parasites, meaning they cannot make their own food and must feed on other organisms or dead matter. Green plants produce their own food through photosynthesis. While fungi reproduce by spores, bacteria reproduce mainly by splitting, and some plants also use spores."

    "explanation": "Mosquitoes undergo Complete Metamorphosis (Egg -> Larva -> Pupa -> Adult - 4 stages), where the larva is entirely different from the adult. Grasshoppers undergo Incomplete Metamorphosis (Egg -> Nymph -> Adult - 3 stages), and the nymph looks similar to the adult. The food sources and habitats of the larva (water) and adult (air) mosquito are also different."

      "Good conductor of heat and light-coloured outer surface.",
      "Poor conductor of heat and dark-coloured inner surface."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "To keep cold things cold, the container must prevent heat from entering. It requires a poor conductor (insulator) to slow down heat transfer through the material. A light-coloured (especially white or reflective) surface is needed to reflect radiant heat away from the container, further slowing down warming."

    "questionText": "When a beaker of hot water is covered tightly with a plastic lid, small water droplets form on the inner surface of the lid. If the beaker is then transferred to a refrigerator, what will happen to these droplets and why?",
    "options": [
      "The droplets will evaporate faster because the air inside the refrigerator is drier.",
      "The droplets will remain the same size because the lid prevents further gas exchange.",
      "The droplets will form frost as the temperature drops below freezing point.",
      "More water vapour will condense, and the existing droplets will grow larger due to lower temperatures."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "Condensation occurs when water vapour loses heat and turns back into liquid water. The refrigerator lowers the temperature significantly. This loss of heat causes more water vapour trapped inside the container to condense onto the cool surfaces (like the lid), making the existing droplets increase in size."

    "questionText": "A bar magnet X is fixed to a table. Another bar magnet Y is moved towards magnet X. Magnet Y is seen to push X away (repel it). What can be definitively concluded about magnet Y?",
    "options": [
      "Magnet Y must be a magnet, and the pole facing X is the same as the pole of X facing Y.",
      "Magnet Y is definitely an induced magnet (a piece of soft iron).",

      "Magnet Y is attracted to Magnet X but is being held back by an external force."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "Repulsion is the only reliable test for identifying a magnet. If two objects repel, they must both be magnets, and the poles facing each other must be like poles (North-North or South-South). Attraction happens between opposite poles OR between a magnet and a magnetic material, so attraction is inconclusive proof of magnetism."

    "questionText": "How do non-flowering plants like ferns differ structurally from non-flowering plants like mosses, a difference that allows ferns to grow much taller?",
    "options": [
      "Ferns reproduce using seeds, while mosses use spores.",
      "Ferns have chlorophyll for photosynthesis, while mosses do not.",
      "Ferns possess a vascular system (xylem and phloem) to transport water and food efficiently, whereas mosses lack true vascular tissue.",
      "Mosses require insects for pollination, while ferns rely on wind."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Both ferns and mosses reproduce by spores and both have chlorophyll. However, ferns possess specialized vascular tissues (like tubes) to transport water and nutrients against gravity, enabling them to grow larger. Mosses lack this system, restricting them to short, moist environments."

    "options": [
      "It is the main site where all digested food nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream.",
      "It produces bile to help break down fats.",
      "It churns the food and mixes it with strong acid and enzymes to begin protein digestion.",
      "It only absorbs excess water from undigested food."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "The stomach primarily acts as a mixer and reservoir. It secretes hydrochloric acid (strong acid) and enzymes (like pepsin) to start the chemical breakdown of proteins. Absorption mainly occurs in the small intestine. Bile is produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, not the stomach. Water absorption happens in the large intestine."

    "options": [
      "Temperature P > Temperature Q, because matt black surfaces are better absorbers of heat radiation.",
      "Temperature P < Temperature Q, because glossy white surfaces reflect heat better.",
      "Temperature P = Temperature Q, because both thermometers are absorbing the same amount of light energy.",
      "Temperature P > Temperature Q, because matt black surfaces are poorer reflectors of light."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "Matt black surfaces are excellent absorbers of heat radiation (light energy), causing the air around the thermometer bulb to heat up more quickly. Glossy white surfaces are excellent reflectors and poor absorbers, resulting in a lower temperature reading."

    "options": [
      "Car A will travel further than Car B because the rough surface provides greater grip.",
      "Car B will travel further than Car A because the smooth surface results in less friction.",
      "Car A and Car B will travel the same distance because the initial pushing force was identical.",
      "Car B will stop faster because friction acts as a resistance force."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Friction is the force that opposes motion. Rough surfaces generate more friction than smooth surfaces. Since Car B is on a smooth track, it experiences less friction and therefore travels a greater distance before stopping compared to Car A."

      "Particles are packed closely together but can slide and roll over one another.",
      "Particles are closely packed, occupy a fixed volume, but can change shape easily."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "Water is a liquid. Liquids have a fixed volume but no fixed shape (they take the shape of the container). Their particles are close together but have enough energy to slide past each other, allowing the liquid to flow."

    "options": [
      "The food substances produced by the leaves travelled down the stem.",
      "The outermost cells absorbed the dye but were not part of the transport system.",
      "The dye was carried up the stem by the water-carrying tubes (xylem vessels).",
      "The entire stem absorbed the red dye evenly, indicating osmosis."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Water absorbed by the roots travels up the stem through specialized tubes called xylem vessels. The red dye mixed with the water is carried along these vessels, staining them red, usually found towards the outer parts of the woody stem."

    "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "In a fair test, only the independent variable (container material) should change. All other factors (control variables) must remain constant. Factors like the volume of water, initial temperature, and the environment (surrounding temperature) affect the rate of heat loss and must be identical for all containers. While surface area should also be controlled, the surrounding temperature is crucial as it determines the temperature gradient for cooling."

Let's adjust the options based on common P4 magnetic materials: Iron/Steel. Let's assume R is Nickel, or check the provided options again. If R is Copper, the answer must be adjusted. Assuming standard P4 difficulty where only Iron/Steel/Nickel/Cobalt are magnetic, and Copper is not, the only definite magnetic material listed is Steel (P). Let's change R to Nickel or assume the teacher meant a copper-coated steel wire. Given the need for a pair, let's change R to Nickel Coin instead of Copper Wire for clarity, OR change R to a Magnetic Material. Let's make R an iron paper clip. \nNew R: R (Iron paper clip).\nThus, P (Steel nail) and R (Iron paper clip) are magnetic."

    "questionText": "When we breathe in, air travels from the nose/mouth to the windpipe, and then into the lungs. What is the primary function of the windpipe in this process?",
    "options": [
      "To exchange carbon dioxide for oxygen in the blood.",
      "To clean, warm, and moisten the air before it reaches the lungs.",
      "To pump the air out of the body when we exhale.",
      "To serve as a passage for air to travel to the bronchi and lungs."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "The primary role of the windpipe (trachea) is structural: to act as the main tube connecting the throat to the lungs, ensuring a clear pathway for air delivery. The exchange of gases happens in the lungs (air sacs). Filtering/warming happens mainly in the nasal passages."

    "questionText": "A scientist conducted an experiment to find out how the amount of water absorbed by a plant is affected by humidity. Which one of the following variables must be kept the same to ensure a fair test?",
    "options": [
      "The mass of the plant at the start of the experiment.",
      "The duration the plant is exposed to light each day.",
      "The type of soil used in the potted plant.",
      "The total surface area of the leaves of the plant."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "To ensure a fair test, only the independent variable (humidity) should change, and the dependent variable (water absorbed) is measured. Variables that affect water absorption, such as the rate of transpiration which is related to the leaf surface area, must be kept constant. More leaves mean more transpiration, affecting the result regardless of humidity. The mass and soil type are important but leaf surface area is the most critical factor affecting the rate of water loss and thus absorption."

      "The tiny tubes responsible for transporting water and minerals.",
      "The structure responsible for supporting the leaves."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "The red colour in the water is absorbed by the roots and transported upwards through the water-carrying tubes (xylem), which are part of the vascular bundles. When cut horizontally, these tubes will show the red colour, demonstrating the transport function of the plant's system."

    "questionText": "A dry metal spoon and a dry wooden spoon were left on a table in an air-conditioned room (20°C) for several hours. When a student touched both spoons, the metal spoon felt colder than the wooden spoon. Which statement best explains this observation?",
    "options": [
      "The metal spoon was actually at a lower temperature than the wooden spoon.",
      "The metal spoon has a rougher texture, allowing heat to escape faster.",
      "Metal is a better conductor of heat than wood, removing heat from the hand quickly.",
      "Wood is a good insulator, trapping the cold air around the spoon."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Objects left in the same room for a long time will reach thermal equilibrium and have the same temperature (20°C). Metal feels colder because it is a good heat conductor and rapidly conducts heat away from the hand, leading to a faster sensation of heat loss (coldness). Wood is a poor conductor, so heat transfer is slower."

      "Stomach: Complete digestion of fats; Water absorption: Small intestine.",
      "Stomach: Breaking down food into smaller pieces; Water absorption: Large intestine.",
      "Stomach: Digesting proteins using strong acids; Water absorption: Large intestine.",
      "Stomach: Absorbing digested nutrients; Water absorption: Small intestine."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "The stomach primarily digests proteins using acids and enzymes (like pepsin). While some water is absorbed in the small intestine, the large intestine is the primary organ responsible for absorbing most of the remaining water, compacting waste into faeces."

      "Surface A: 50 cm",
      "Surface B: 75 cm",
      "Surface C: 12 cm",
      "Surface D: 40 cm"
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Friction is a force that opposes motion. When the applied force is constant, a greater frictional force will cause the object to stop sooner, resulting in a shorter distance travelled. Surface C (12 cm) is the shortest distance, indicating the greatest opposition to motion (greatest friction)."

    "questionText": "A plant is placed in a sealed jar with only light and water available. After several hours, the plant died. Assuming the temperature was suitable, what was the most likely limiting factor that caused the plant to die?",
    "options": [
      "Lack of soil nutrients.",
      "Lack of carbon dioxide.",
      "Lack of oxygen.",
      "Lack of mineral salts."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Photosynthesis requires light, water, and carbon dioxide. In a sealed jar, the initial CO2 supply is used up quickly. Although the plant produces oxygen during photosynthesis, it needs a continuous supply of CO2 to make food and survive. Lack of CO2 halts food production. Soil nutrients and mineral salts are not consumed rapidly enough to cause immediate death."

    "questionText": "When setting up an aquarium, which of the following non-living items is essential for fish survival because it dissolves and is taken in by the fish?",
    "options": [
      "Water plants, which provide food.",
      "Gravel, which provides minerals.",
      "Air from an air pump, which provides oxygen.",
      "A heater, which provides warmth."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Fish require dissolved oxygen to breathe. An air pump introduces air into the water, allowing gaseous oxygen to dissolve. While plants produce oxygen, an air pump is crucial for supplementing the necessary dissolved gas. Plants provide food only if the fish are herbivores; gravel provides anchorage for plants; a heater is for temperature control."

      "Fungi make their own food, but ferns absorb food from dead organisms.",
      "Fungi absorb food from other organisms, but ferns make their own food.",
      "Fungi absorb food through roots, while ferns absorb food through spores.",
      "Both fungi and ferns absorb food from decaying matter."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Ferns are green plants and possess chlorophyll, enabling them to make their own food via photosynthesis. Fungi lack chlorophyll and must obtain nutrients by absorbing food from living or dead organisms (saprophytes or parasites)."

      "55°",
      "70°",
      "90°"
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "According to the Law of Reflection, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. If the angle of incidence is 35°, the angle of reflection is also 35°. The angle between the incident ray and the reflected ray is the sum of these two angles: 35° + 35° = 70°."

      "A graph showing the temperature rising continuously over time.",
      "A graph showing the temperature increasing and then decreasing slightly.",
      "A graph showing the temperature rising until 100°C, then remaining constant.",
      "A graph showing the temperature remaining constant from the start."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Under standard atmospheric pressure, water boils at 100°C. Once water reaches its boiling point, the absorbed heat energy is used entirely for the change of state (liquid to gas/steam) rather than raising the temperature. Therefore, the temperature remains constant at 100°C until all the water has evaporated."

      "Z attracts X, Z attracts Y.",
      "Z repels X, Z attracts Y.",
      "Z attracts X, Z repels Y.",
      "Z repels X, Z repels Y."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "When a magnet is broken, each piece immediately forms its own North and South pole. If X's exposed end is North (N), the hidden side touching Z must be South (S). If Y's exposed end is South (S), the hidden side touching Z must be North (N). Therefore, the ends of Z are N-S (or S-N). Assuming Z is in the middle, Z's right side (touching Y) is N, and Z's left side (touching X) is S. S (Z) attracts N (X). N (Z) repels N (Y). Thus, Z attracts X and Z repels Y."

      "The production of concentrated urine by desert rodents.",
      "The ability of a snake to burrow during the day."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Reducing water loss is crucial in the desert. While large ears (heat dissipation) and burrowing (avoiding heat) are important adaptations, producing highly concentrated urine is a physiological adaptation that minimizes the water volume excreted, thereby maximizing water retention in the body. Thick fur primarily offers insulation against intense heat, not necessarily preventing metabolic water loss."

      "Size increases, sharpness decreases.",
      "Size decreases, sharpness increases.",
      "Size decreases, sharpness decreases.",
      "Size increases, sharpness remains the same."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "When the object is moved closer to the screen (away from the light source), the shadow size decreases. Additionally, being closer to the screen results in less blurring due to penumbra effects, making the shadow sharper and more defined."

      "Both the mass reading and the weight reading decrease.",
      "The weight reading remains the same, but the mass reading decreases.",
      "Both the mass reading and the weight reading remain the same."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "Mass is the amount of matter in an object and remains constant regardless of location. Weight is the measure of the gravitational pull on that mass. Since the Moon's gravity is much weaker than Earth's, the object's weight will decrease, and the spring balance (which measures force/weight) will show a lower reading. The concept of mass remains unchanged."

      "The adult stage of the mosquito is longer than its egg stage."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "A chicken's egg requires about 21 days for incubation (hatching). A mosquito's egg hatches very quickly, often within 1-3 days in water. Therefore, the chicken's egg stage is significantly longer. The larval stage is often the longest growth stage for both mosquitoes and butterflies."

      "They will not interact.",
      "The interaction depends on the material of Magnet R."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "If P repels Q, it means the poles facing each other are the same (e.g., P's North faces Q's North). If Q attracts R, it means Q and R have opposite poles facing each other (e.g., Q's North faces R's South). Therefore, P's North pole and R's South pole will attract. This requires deductive logic about magnetic poles (Like poles repel, unlike poles attract)."

    "options": [
      "Melting.",
      "Condensation.",
      "Evaporation.",
      "Freezing."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "When liquid volume decreases slowly in open air, it is due to evaporation, where liquid changes into gas (water vapor) by absorbing heat energy from the surroundings. A faster decrease means a higher rate of evaporation."

      "They cannot move from place to place.",
      "They cannot make their own food through photosynthesis."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "The fundamental difference between green plants and organisms like fungi and bacteria (excluding cyanobacteria) is their mode of nutrition. Green plants make their own food using sunlight (photosynthesis), while fungi and bacteria obtain food by feeding on decaying matter or other organisms (they lack chlorophyll)."

    "questionText": "A student conducted an experiment to find out which material is the best heat insulator. She wrapped four identical ice cubes tightly with four different materials (P, Q, R, S) and left them in a warm room for 30 minutes. Which result would indicate the best insulating material?",
    "options": [
      "The material that collected the most melted water.",
      "The material that kept the ice cube's temperature lowest.",
      "The material that felt the coldest to the touch after 30 minutes.",
      "The material that prevented the ice cube from melting completely."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "A heat insulator reduces the rate of heat transfer from the surroundings to the ice cube. If the ice cube's temperature remains the lowest after 30 minutes, it means the least amount of heat energy was transferred to it, making that material the best insulator. Since all ice cubes start at 0°C, the best insulator will prevent the temperature from rising above 0°C or melt the least."

      "Steel",
      "Wood",
      "Another magnet"
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "Magnetic attraction occurs between opposite poles or between a magnet and a magnetic material (like iron or steel). However, repulsion only occurs between like poles. If Object X can both attract AND repel the poles of a magnet, Object X must be a magnet itself, and the end brought near the South pole must also be a South pole."

    "questionText": "A student wanted to determine if light is necessary for a potted plant to photosynthesize and produce starch. Which of the following setups must be used as the control for a fair test?",
    "options": [
      "A plant left in the dark for 48 hours.",
      "A plant with variegated leaves exposed to light.",
      "A plant with a leaf covered completely with black paper, exposed to light.",
      "A plant exposed to light after being kept in the dark for 48 hours."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "To test if light is necessary, the experiment needs two variables that are identical except for the presence of light. The standard setup involves de-starching the plant (keeping it in the dark for 48 hours). The control (what normally happens) is then exposing the de-starched plant to light, while the experimental setup (the variable being tested) would be keeping the plant in darkness or covering part of a leaf (option 3) during the test period. Option 3 is the experimental setup testing the effect of light exclusion, not the control setup."

      "Amphibians",
      "Mammals",
      "Birds"
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Amphibians (like frogs) typically lay eggs in water, where external fertilisation occurs. Their life cycle involves distinct stages such as the tadpole (larval stage) transforming dramatically into an adult frog (metamorphosis). Reptiles, Mammals, and Birds usually undergo internal fertilisation and generally do not show complete metamorphosis."

      "The shadow remains the same size but shifts position.",
      "The shadow disappears completely."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Light travels in straight lines. When the light source is moved further away, the light rays strike the object more parallelly. This results in a smaller area of the screen being blocked, making the shadow smaller. Because the light source is acting more like a point source from a distance, the shadow edges (penumbra) become less noticeable, making the shadow sharper."

      "Magnetic attraction, then filtering, then evaporation.",
      "Filtering, then evaporation, then heating.",
      "Evaporation, then magnetic attraction, then filtering."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "The most efficient separation sequence uses the easiest methods first. 1. Use Magnetic Attraction to remove the iron filings. 2. Add water to dissolve the salt and leave X undissolved. 3. Use Filtering to separate the insoluble substance X from the salt solution. 4. Use Evaporation to obtain the solid salt from the water. Heating (option 0) is unnecessary unless trying to melt X."

    "options": [
      "Boiling occurs only at the surface, while evaporation occurs throughout the liquid.",
      "Boiling occurs at a fixed temperature, while evaporation occurs at any temperature above the melting point.",
      "Both processes require heat energy from an external source to take place.",
      "Boiling is a slower process than evaporation when exposed to wind."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Boiling is the rapid vaporization of a liquid at a fixed temperature (the boiling point) and occurs throughout the liquid. Evaporation is the slow vaporization of a liquid that occurs only at the surface and can happen at any temperature between the melting and boiling points."

      "Pouring cold water over the glass jar only to make it contract."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Most materials expand when heated. By pouring hot water ONLY over the metal lid, the metal lid will expand slightly more than the glass jar below it, increasing the diameter of the lid and making it easier to unscrew. Heating the jar (option 1) would also expand the jar neck, making the seal tighter."

    "questionText": "Why do wet clothes dry faster on a windy day compared to a still day, assuming temperature and humidity remain constant?",
    "options": [
      "Wind increases the temperature, speeding up evaporation.",
      "Wind replaces the humid air near the clothes with drier air.",
      "Wind increases the boiling point of the water molecules.",
      "Wind causes the water molecules to condense faster."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Evaporation slows down when the air above the surface is saturated with water vapour (high humidity). Wind blows away the water vapour molecules concentrated near the clothes, replacing them with drier air, thus maintaining a steeper concentration gradient and increasing the rate of evaporation."

      "P, because heat rises directly from the source.",
      "Q, because conduction is faster than convection.",
      "P, because the surface water heats up immediately.",
      "Q, because convection currents distribute heat efficiently throughout the water."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "Water is heated primarily by convection. When heated from the bottom (Q), the lower, warmer water expands and rises, while the cooler, denser water sinks, setting up convection currents that quickly distribute heat throughout the volume. Heating from the top (P) relies mostly on slow conduction downwards, as the warmer water stays at the top."

    "questionText": "Why does a metal spoon feel colder to the touch than a wooden spoon of the same temperature in the same room?",
    "options": [
      "Metal is actually colder than wood.",
      "Metal stores less heat than wood.",
      "Metal is a better insulator than wood.",
      "Metal conducts heat away from your hand faster than wood."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "Both spoons are at room temperature. Metal feels colder because it is an excellent conductor of heat, transferring the heat energy quickly from your warm hand to the spoon. Wood is a poor conductor (insulator) and transfers heat slowly, so it feels warmer."

    "questionText": "If a caterpillar (larva) population suddenly decreased due to pesticide use, what immediate effect would be seen on the adult butterfly population in the subsequent generation?",
    "options": [
      "The adult population would increase due to less competition.",
      "The adult population would decrease sharply.",
      "The adult population would remain unchanged as they feed differently.",
      "The adult population would increase due to increased food for the remaining larvae."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Since caterpillars undergo complete metamorphosis, they are the previous stage of the adult butterfly. A large reduction in the larval population means fewer individuals can complete development into pupae and then into adults, causing the adult population to decrease sharply."

    "options": [
      "Water in P is hotter because wood is a better conductor of heat than metal.",
      "Water in Q is hotter because metal is a better insulator of heat than wood.",
      "Water in P is hotter because wood is a poorer conductor of heat than metal.",
      "Water in Q is hotter because the metal tray reflected heat back into the cup."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Heat loss occurs from the base of the cup to the material it sits on. Metal is a good conductor of heat, so Cup Q loses heat faster to the surroundings via the metal tray. Wood is a poor conductor (an insulator), meaning Cup P loses heat slower, thus the water in P will remain hotter after 10 minutes."

    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Attraction always occurs between opposite poles (N-S). However, attraction also occurs between a magnet and any unmagnetised material that is magnetic (e.g., iron, cobalt, nickel). Since BOTH poles of Magnet A attract Object B, Object B cannot be a magnet (as one pole would repel it); thus, it must be an unmagnetised magnetic substance."

    "questionText": "Two identical boxes, X and Y, are pushed across different surfaces. Box X requires a smaller force to start moving than Box Y. What does this indicate about the surfaces?",
    "options": [
      "The surface under X is rougher than the surface under Y.",
      "The surface under Y is rougher than the surface under X.",
      "Box Y is heavier than Box X.",
      "Both surfaces are equally smooth but Box Y was pushed faster."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "The force required to start movement must overcome static friction. Since Box X required a smaller force, the friction acting on it must be less. Less friction means the surface under Box X is smoother, and consequently, the surface under Box Y is rougher."

    "questionText": "A scientist observed a plant kept in a sealed glass container for a week. The container was exposed to sunlight. If the oxygen level inside the container decreased significantly by the end of the week, which plant characteristic is most likely true?",
    "options": [
      "The plant lacked sufficient water for photosynthesis.",
      "The plant was a water plant living underwater.",
      "The plant was a non-green plant, such as a fungus.",
      "The plant was actively reproducing using flowers."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "If the plant was green, photosynthesis (which produces oxygen) would occur faster than respiration (which uses oxygen), increasing the oxygen level. A decrease in oxygen suggests that only respiration (oxygen consumption) occurred, meaning the organism was likely a non-green plant or fungus that cannot photosynthesize."

    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "As the object (boy) moves away from the point source of light (streetlight), the angle between the light rays passing the boy’s edges and the ground becomes smaller, causing the shadow to lengthen (become larger). Since the light source is further away, the light rays become less divergent, but typically, moving the object further from the light source and closer to the surface/screen generally makes the shadow less sharp due to minor secondary light sources or scattering effects in a real-world scenario, but the primary reason for decreased sharpness here is often confusion between a point source (very sharp) and a common street light source which has some area (resulting in penumbra/less sharpness when the object is further away from the light source and closer to the ground, especially regarding the edges being less defined)."

    "explanation": "First, calculate the initial volume: V = 5 cm * 4 cm * 2 cm = 40 cm³. Initial density: D = Mass / Volume = 80 g / 40 cm³ = 2.0 g/cm³. When the object is cut in half, the mass is halved (80 g / 2 = 40 g) and the volume is halved (40 cm³ / 2 = 20 cm³). Density is an intensive property and remains the same: D = 40 g / 20 cm³ = 2.0 g/cm³."

If the same measurement is taken again the next morning before sunrise, which of the following is most likely true about the change in mass, assuming no watering occurred?",
    "options": [
      "The mass decreases because the plant uses stored food at night.",
      "The mass increases because the plant absorbs water from the air at night.",
      "The mass decreases because the plant releases water vapour and carbon dioxide through respiration all the time.",
      "The mass remains the same because the plant stops functioning when it is dark."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Plants continuously lose water vapour through transpiration (even slightly at night) and release carbon dioxide during respiration (day and night). Both processes result in a net loss of matter (especially water), causing the overall mass of the potted setup to decrease slightly overnight. While stored food is used, the main measurable mass change over a short period is due to water loss and gas exchange."

    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "Caterpillar (butterfly) and mosquito undergo complete metamorphosis (egg -> larva -> pupa -> adult), meaning the young (larva) does not resemble the adult. The frog undergoes metamorphosis but is classified separately (amphibian life cycle). The young of the frog (tadpole) does not resemble the adult frog. Therefore, the statement that the young of the caterpillar and the mosquito do not resemble their adults is correct."

    "questionText": "A cup of hot coffee is left on a table. Which of the following is the primary way the coffee loses heat to the surrounding air?",
    "options": [
      "Heat is conducted through the air molecules touching the coffee surface.",
      "The heat energy is converted into light energy.",
      "Heat is transferred by convection as cooler air sinks and warmer air rises.",
      "The heat energy is absorbed by the table."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Heat transfer in fluids (like air) mainly occurs through convection. The air immediately above the hot coffee warms up, becomes less dense, and rises, replaced by cooler, denser air, creating a circulating current that carries heat away."

    "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "In a fair test, the manipulated (independent) variable is the factor being changed or tested. Since the student wants to compare heat insulation, the type of material is the only thing that should differ between the setups. All other factors (initial temperature, size, time) must be kept constant."

      "A puddle of water disappearing after rain."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Condensation is the process where water vapour (gas) turns into liquid water. Dew formation occurs when warm, moist air touches the cooler surface of the grass, causing the water vapour in the air to condense into liquid droplets."

      "Melting and freezing.",
      "Boiling and freezing.",
      "Evaporation and boiling."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "The drop in water level is mainly due to evaporation (liquid turning to gas/vapour). However, condensation also occurs constantly in the air above the water, forming tiny liquid droplets that may settle back down, but evaporation rate is higher in sunlight, causing the net loss. (Note: While evaporation is the main loss, the question asks for two processes present in the water cycle. Condensation is always happening, although evaporation dominates the loss.)"

      "Q only",
      "P and Q only",
      "Q and R only"

    "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "Repulsion is the definitive test for a magnet. Since Q repels R, both Q and R must be magnets (like poles facing each other). Attraction (P attracts Q, R attracts P) can occur between two magnets OR between a magnet and a magnetic material (like iron or steel), so P is not necessarily a magnet."

    "options": [
      "More sugar dissolves at 20°C because the water molecules move slower.",
      "The same amount of sugar dissolves at both temperatures.",
      "More sugar dissolves at 40°C because heat increases solubility.",
      "Sugar does not dissolve in water; it only suspends."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "For most solids (like sugar), solubility increases as the temperature of the solvent (water) increases. Higher temperatures cause the water molecules to move faster, allowing them to break down and incorporate the solid more effectively."

      "The student must provide oxygen and moisture for respiration and germination.",
      "The student must remove the cotyledons as well."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "The seed needs oxygen for respiration to release energy and moisture to activate enzymes for germination, regardless of the seed coat being present or removed. Removing the protective layer makes it more vulnerable, but these conditions are still critical for survival and germination."

      "A is a better reflector of heat than B.",
      "A has a smaller surface area than B."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "When objects feel 'warmer' or 'colder' than room temperature, it relates to how fast they transfer heat to or from your hand. If A feels warmer, it is conducting heat away from your hand faster than B. Therefore, A is a better conductor of heat than B. (Note: Both are at room temp, but the sensation is due to heat flow.)"

    "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "A good heat insulator slows down the rate of heat loss to the surrounding environment. Starting with boiling water (100°C), the cup that maintains the highest temperature after 20 minutes (S: 90°C) is the best insulator, as the least amount of heat has escaped."

    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "When conducting experiments on photosynthesis (which produces starch), scientists usually 'destarch' the plant first. By placing the plant in the dark, photosynthesis stops, and the plant uses up any starch already stored in its leaves for respiration. This ensures that any starch found after the experiment was produced only during the test period."

    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "When the light source (torchlight) is moved closer to an opaque object, the angle of the light rays hitting the object increases, causing the shadow cast on the distant screen (the wall) to become larger. Also, being closer to the light source generally makes the edges of the shadow less defined (blurrier) due to increased light spread (penumbra effect), though for P4 level, 'larger' is the key consequence."

    "options": [
      "To increase the rate of photosynthesis in the leaves.",
      "To ensure the plant can access sufficient anchorage and water, as sandy soil retains water poorly.",
      "To absorb carbon dioxide directly from the soil air pockets.",
      "To store more starch underground for the dry season."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Sandy soil is porous and drains water quickly, meaning water (and dissolved minerals) are less available. A widespread root system is needed to search a larger volume of soil for water. Additionally, sandy soil offers less resistance, so extensive roots are needed to provide stable anchorage and prevent the plant from falling over."

    "questionText": "A plant is kept in a sealed glass jar with sufficient soil and water, and is placed in sunlight. Why is the plant still likely to die after several weeks, despite having light and water?",
    "options": [
      "The sealed jar prevents the plant from absorbing enough light.",

    "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "Repulsion occurs when like poles meet. P's right side is North, so Q's left side must be North to repel it. R's left side must be South to repel Q's right side (since R's right side is South, its left side must be North). Thus, Q must have North on both its left and right sides (meaning Q is not a standard bar magnet but likely two North poles facing out, or a complex setup meant to test the understanding of poles). The simplest interpretation following standard repulsion rules is that Q must repel both ends. If P is N on the right, Q must be N on the left. If R is S on the right, R is N on the left, so Q must be N on the right. Both ends of Q must be North."

      "Water in Q will be cooler because white absorbs light faster."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Dark or black surfaces are better absorbers of heat energy (from the sun) than light or white surfaces. Therefore, Container P, being black, will absorb heat faster, making the water warmer."

    "questionText": "Which comparison between a healthy bone and a muscle is correct?",
    "options": [
      "Bones allow movement, but muscles give the body shape.",
      "Bones protect organs, while muscles contract and relax to cause movement.",
      "Bones store water, and muscles store minerals.",
      "Both bones and muscles are non-living structures."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Bones provide structure and protection (e.g., rib cage protects the lungs). Muscles are attached to bones and work in pairs by contracting (shortening) and relaxing (lengthening) to pull bones and cause movement."

    "questionText": "Why is it important for the seeds of large trees like the Angsana to be dispersed far away from the parent tree?",
    "options": [
      "The seeds need shade to germinate properly.",
      "The young seedlings must compete with the parent tree for sunlight, water, and nutrients.",
      "The seeds will only grow in very damp conditions found far away.",
      "The parent tree is poisonous to its own seedlings."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Seed dispersal reduces competition for essential resources like light, water, and nutrients between the parent plant and the emerging seedlings, giving the young plant a better chance of survival."
